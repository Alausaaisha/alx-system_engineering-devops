# Nginx should be listening on port 80
# When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page)
# using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Hello World!
# As an answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine

# You canâ€™t use systemctl for restarting nginx
